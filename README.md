# Overview
This project was started an initated by Siddarth Narasimhan, begun on December 21st, 2018. The goal of this project is to help First Year Engineering Science students with the first bridge project they must complete in CIV102, a civil engineering stuctures course. This truss solver solves statically determinate truss bridges with the method of joints, solves the virtual truss, gives you the best possible HSS configuration and outputs all data in a table.
