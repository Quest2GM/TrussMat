# TrussMat: Statically Determinate Truss Bridge Solver for EngSci Students
This project was started an initated on December 21st, 2018. The goal of this project is to help First Year Engineering Science students at the University of Toronto with the first bridge project they must complete in CIV102, a civil engineering structural design course. This truss solver solves statically determinate truss bridges with the method of joints, solves the virtual truss bridge and gives you the best possible HSS configuration for the truss.

Project Working Status: In Progress (as of 16-Apr-2019).

## Motivation
As an Engineering Science student myself, I found this project to be quite tedious to complete within the two week frame we were given. It resulted in me having to do my very first all nighter. One of the biggest struggles for me during the project was trying to find a way to check my work. The math behind solving a truss is quite simple and intuitive, but any small error that you make early on will propogate. Designated by my group to do the calculation part of the project, which was worth 50% of our grade, I spent most of my time checking my work to ensure that I did not make a calculation error early on. Our group's final grade for the calculations portion was 48/50, and the two marks that we lost were because of calculation mistakes.

While there are several existing online truss solvers, they come with several disadvantages. The most powerful truss solver that I know of is [SkyCiv](https://skyciv.com/), but downloading the software does cost money. Other softwares such as [Fast Truss Solver](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/fast-truss-solver/9pc290v41k2q) are difficult to use and do not have all the features required for the project. A past EngSci student, Steven He, has also created an [truss bridge solver](http://engsci.stevenhe.com/trusssolver2) but is, functionality-wise, limited. TrussMat resolves all of the aforementioned issues.
